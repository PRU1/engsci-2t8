	abstract={Smart materials have attracted considerable attention in the medical field. In particular, shape memory alloys (SMAs) are most commonly utilized for their superelasticity (SE) in orthopaedic treatment. In this study, the resin struts of a flexible brace for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) are replaced with different conventional materials and an SMA. The corrective mechanism mainly depends on the compressive force applied by the brace at the desired location. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the materials used and the interface pressure are both critical factors that influence the treatment effectiveness. The results indicate that titanium is the most rigid among the five types of materials, whereas the brace with SMA struts presents the best recovery properties and the most stable interface pressure. A radiographic examination of two patients with AIS is then conducted to validate the results, which shows that the SMA struts can provide better correction of thoracic curvature. These findings suggest that SMAs can be applied in orthoses because their SE allows for continuous and controllable corrective forces.},

	abstract = 	 {Whenever a voltage potential is present between two points-in close enough proximity-for a human or an animal to bridge the gap between them, there is the possibility for current to flow through the body. For the purposes of this paper, the contact scenarios of interest are limited to publicly or privately accessible locations such as swimming pools, hot tubs, pipe lines, street lights, electric service boxes and other areas where electric shock complaints are reported. This paper supplies a review of the literature on human and animal response to ac current along with a review of the standards and documents that presently have published values for voltage, current, or resistance. These documents prove useful in understanding the establishment of published limits and levels of concern. A methodology is described whereby new levels of interest for contact scenarios may be developed using a systematic process that follows the basic methodology applied in establishment of prior limits.}

	pages={e0000104},
	abstract={Wearable devices are increasingly present in the health context, as tools for biomedical research and clinical care. In this context, wearables are considered key tools for a more digital, personalised, preventive medicine. At the same time, wearables have also been associated with issues and risks, such as those connected to privacy and data sharing. Yet, discussions in the literature have mostly focused on either technical or ethical considerations, framing these as largely separate areas of discussion, and the contribution of wearables to the collection, development, application of biomedical knowledge has only partially been discussed. To fill in these gaps, in this article we provide an epistemic (knowledge-related) overview of the main functions of wearable technology for health: monitoring, screening, detection, and prediction. On this basis, we identify 4 areas of concern in the application of wearables for these functions: data quality, balanced estimations, health equity, and fairness. To move the field forward in an effective and beneficial direction, we present recommendations for the 4 areas: local standards of quality, interoperability, access, and representativity.},

	journal={Health Psychology: Official Journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association},
	volume={34},
	number={6},
	pages={632-641},
	abstract={OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis that muscular states are related to emotions has been supported predominantly by research on facial expressions. However, body posture also may be important to the initiation and modulation of emotions. This experiment aimed to investigate whether an upright seated posture could influence affective and cardiovascular responses to a psychological stress task, relative to a slumped seated posture.
METHOD: There were 74 participants who were randomly assigned to either a slumped or upright seated posture. Their backs were strapped with physiotherapy tape to hold this posture throughout the study. Participants were told a cover story to reduce expectation effects of posture. Participants completed a reading task, the Trier Social Stress speech task, assessments of mood, self-esteem, and perceived threat. Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously measured.
RESULTS: Upright participants reported higher self-esteem, more arousal, better mood, and lower fear, compared to slumped participants. Linguistic analysis showed slumped participants used more negative emotion words, first-person singular pronouns, affective process words, sadness words, and fewer positive emotion words and total words during the speech. Upright participants had higher pulse pressure during and after the stressor.
CONCLUSIONS: Adopting an upright seated posture in the face of stress can maintain self-esteem, reduce negative mood, and increase positive mood compared to a slumped posture. Furthermore, sitting upright increases rate of speech and reduces self-focus. Sitting upright may be a simple behavioral strategy to help build resilience to stress. The research is consistent with embodied cognition theories that muscular and autonomic states influence emotional responding.},

	journal={Preventive Medicine Reports},
	volume={36},
	pages={102422},
	abstract={As body posture problems become more severe and tend to be younger, college students pay less attention to the effects of poor body posture. This study is an analysis of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to body posture among college and university students. A random sample of 1012 college students aged 18–21 years old from Anhui Polytechnic University was randomly selected to distribute and collect the questionnaires by online questionnaire in April 2023. Descriptive statistics were also used to analyze the response rates of college students on the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) theory of body posture. The results of the study showed that the majority of subjects demonstrated good knowledge and attitudes towards healthy body posture; Most of the sample, 66.8% were clear about the definition of body posture, and 71.9% needed a body posture assessment to understand their body posture problems, but only 27% would develop an exercise program to improve poor body posture. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that Students with higher knowledge and attitudes have good motor behavior in correcting poor body posture. In addition, our study found that among college students in the age range of 18–21 years, the younger the age, the better their behavior in improving poor body posture through exercise. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of knowledge about healthy body posture and aim to promote knowledge education programs about healthy body posture among college students and to reduce the risks associated with poor body posture.},

	title={School Time Experiences of Adolescents with Spinal Deformities during
Brace Treatment: A Qualitative Study},
	journal={Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran},
	volume={36},
	pages={148},
	abstract={Background: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and Scheuermann
kyphosis (SK) are the most common spinal deformities in adolescents aged 10 to
16. During the past 50 years, brace treatment has been suggested as the most
common nonsurgical treatment for AIS and SK. The brace efficacy strongly depends
on wearing time. Also, previous studies indicated that patients with spinal
deformities undergoing brace treatment experience deformity-related emotional
distress. This study aimed to comprehend the experiences of braces-treated
adolescents during school time using a qualitative approach., Methods: This descriptive qualitative research was used with an
interpretative framework and enlisted the help of children with spinal
deformities who have been prescribed "brace wearing." This study was
conducted using semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews and phone
conversations from September 2020 to May 2021. Additionally, content analysis
was employed., Results: A total of 64 participants were interviewed, including 32
adolescents with spinal deformities under brace treatment and their parents (27
mothers, and 5 fathers). Three main categories—concerns, actual problems,
received support—6 subcategories, and 278 codes were discovered following data
analysis about participants' experiences. , Conclusion: Special school-based programs are required for such
tortious conditions. This qualitative study motivates a better understanding of
these special children and their hidden problems and suggests developing a
supportive protocol.},

	journal={Applied Ergonomics},
	volume={19},
	number={4},
	pages={271-274},
	abstract={Several identical prototype shells of a new telephone handset design were weighed in different ways to produce five different overall weights, ranging from 130 to 340 g, and three different balance conditions: transmitter-heavy, receiver-heavy, and balanced. Fifty-two subjects drawn from working people of both sexes and a range of ages participated in pair-comparison tests in which each subject gave a preference judgment for one handset over another for all possible pairs of handsets. They also rated each handset as acceptable or unacceptable. The best overall handset weighed 176 g with the weight equally distributed between transmitter and receiver. The lightest handset (130 g, balanced) was actually preferred by a majority of people over the balanced 176-gram set but twice as many people rated it unacceptable (31% vs 14%). All handsets weighing 176 g or less and the balanced handset weighing 224 g were rated as acceptable by at least two-thirds of the subjects. It is recommended that designs aim at a balanced handset weighing approximately 176 g. It would not be worthwhile to add weight to an unbalanced 176-gram set to bring it into balance.},

	abstract={The Backpod is a logical, practical tool that allows the very hard, tense tissue surrounding the spine to stretch. Very helpful for relieving Tietze syndrome (costochondritis). This usually means lying on the Backpod® for several minutes. The high-tech device is used for mobilization, using the weight of one's own upper body to stretch and lengthen the tense and contorted upper and middle back. After all, this is exactly what usually leads to most problems in the neck area. The Backpod® is the ideal tool for doctors, physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, pharmacists, yoga instructors, occupational therapists, massage therapists and many more. It can be used - for a straight or inwardly curved thoracic spine - for problems in the area of the costovertebral joints - for T4 syndrome - for scoliosis - for Bechterew's disease (ankylosing spondylitis), Scheuermann's disease and Parkinson's disease - before or after neck and thoracic surgery - for mobilization of the sacroiliac joint and for coccygodynia (pain in the coccyx) - for chronic asthma, bronchitis and some other respiratory diseases.},

	title={Effects of Using a Shoulder/Scapular Brace on the Posture and Muscle Activity of Healthy University Students during Prolonged Typing—A Randomized Controlled Cross-Over Trial},
	journal={Healthcare},
	volume={11},
	number={11},
	pages={1555},
	abstract={Laptop use appears to contribute to poor working postures and neck pain among university students. Postural braces have the potential to improve upper back/neck posture and therefore might have a role as an ergonomic aid for this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the short-term effects of scapular bracing on pain, fatigue, cervicothoracic posture, and the activity of the neck and upper-back muscles in healthy college students. A randomized controlled crossover trial was conducted to evaluate the self-reported pain and fatigue, the amplitude and median frequency of surface electromyography in neck extensors, upper trapezius, and lower trapezius, as well as the neck and shoulder sagittal alignment (measured by inertial sensors and digital photographs) during a 30-min typing task in a sample of young, healthy university students with or without a scapular brace. The brace condition resulted in significantly smaller levels of bilateral trapezius muscle activity (p < 0.01). Rounded shoulder posture was slightly better in the brace condition, but these differences were not significant (p > 0.05). There were no significant immediate differences in pain or fatigue scores, neck alignment, or the electromyographic activity of the other muscles tested between brace and non-brace conditions (all p > 0.05). However, bracing appears to immediately reduce the electromyographic activity of the lower trapezius muscles (p < 0.05). These findings shed some light on the possible advantages of scapular bracing for enhancing laptop ergonomics in this group of individuals. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of different types of braces, the importance of matching the brace to the user, and the short- and long-term effects of brace use on computer posture and muscle activity.},
